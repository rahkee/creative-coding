# Figma to Code - Pixel Perfect Conversion Guide

## How to Use This Workflow

### Step 1: Share Your Figma Link
When you have a Figma design ready to convert:
1. Open your Figma file
2. Click "Share" in the top right
3. Set permissions to "Anyone with the link can view"
4. Copy the link (should look like: `https://www.figma.com/file/...` or `https://www.figma.com/design/...`)
5. Share the link with me

### Step 2: Using Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol)
The Figma MCP allows me to:
- **Extract exact dimensions** (width, height, positioning)
- **Get precise colors** (hex, rgba values)
- **Read typography** (font family, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing)
- **Identify spacing** (padding, gaps, margins)
- **Export assets** (images, icons, SVGs)
- **Understand layout structure** (flex, grid, positioning)

### Step 3: What Information Helps Me Most
For the most accurate conversion, please specify:
- **Target viewport/breakpoints** (desktop-first? mobile-first? specific widths?)
- **Interactive states** (hover, active, focus behaviors if not in Figma)
- **Any specific animations or transitions**
- **Browser support requirements**
- **Whether you want Tailwind CSS or vanilla CSS**

### Step 4: Pixel-Perfect Best Practices
I will ensure:
- ✅ Exact spacing using the values from Figma
- ✅ Precise font sizes, weights, and line-heights
- ✅ Accurate colors (including opacity)
- ✅ Proper layout using flex/grid matching Figma's auto-layout
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints if multiple frames exist
- ✅ Export and optimize any images/icons
- ✅ Match border-radius, shadows, and effects exactly

### Step 5: Review & Iterate
After implementation:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Compare side-by-side with Figma
3. Let me know if any adjustments are needed
4. I'll fine-tune spacing, colors, or positioning

## Tips for Best Results
- **Clean Figma files work best** - organized layers, consistent naming
- **Use Figma's Dev Mode** - I can read exact CSS values
- **Auto-layout frames** - help me understand flex/grid structure
- **Component variants** - help me build reusable code patterns
- **Defined color/text styles** - ensure consistency
