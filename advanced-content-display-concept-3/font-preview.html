            </header>

            <div>
                <p>It was 2 AM in Bangkok when I had the best meal of my life. Standing in a narrow alley lit by a single fluorescent bulb, I watched a woman who must have been seventy years old flip <strong>pad thai</strong> in a wok that looked older than me. The noodles hit the plate with a sizzle, and within seconds I was eating something that put every restaurant version I'd ever tried to shame. Total cost: <em>forty baht</em>—roughly one dollar.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>That's the magic of street food. It's not about <del>fancy plating</del> or Michelin stars. It's about <strong>generations of technique</strong>, passed from grandmother to mother to daughter, refined by repetition until the movements become muscle memory. It's food made with <em><strong>soul</strong></em>.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Why Street Food Matters</h2>
            </section>

            <div>
                <p>Walk through any city's oldest neighborhoods, and you'll find street vendors who've been working the same corner for decades. These aren't people chasing trends—they're <strong>culinary historians</strong>, keeping recipes alive that might otherwise disappear into the homogenized blur of global food chains.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>In the narrow alleys of <strong>Marrakech's medina</strong>, the air hangs thick with cumin and woodsmoke. An elderly man tends a clay pot of <em>tangia</em>—lamb shoulder slow-cooked overnight in the embers of a hammam furnace. When he lifts the lid, the meat falls apart at the mere suggestion of a fork.</p>
                    <p><em>"My father taught me,"</em> he says. <em>"And his father taught him. This is how we remember."</em></p>
                </blockquote>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Street food also represents something increasingly rare: <strong>affordable deliciousness</strong>. In a world where a mediocre restaurant meal can cost thirty dollars, the street vendor offers excellence for pocket change.</p>

                <h3>Southeast Asia: Where Street Food is King</h3>
            </section>

            <div>
                <p>Nowhere on earth takes street food more seriously than Southeast Asia. In Thailand, Singapore, and Vietnam, <em>eating out</em> often means eating on the street—even for the wealthy. The hawker stall isn't a budget compromise; it's where you go for the <strong>best food</strong>.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Must-try dishes include:</p>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pad Thai</strong> — The iconic stir-fried noodles, but only from vendors using <code>tamarind paste</code>, never ketchup</li>
                    <li><strong>Bánh mì</strong> — Vietnam's perfect fusion of French baguette and local fillings
                        <ul>
                            <li>The bread must crackle when you bite</li>
                            <li>Watch for the <em>pâté</em>—homemade is incomparably better</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Satay</strong> — Grilled skewers with peanut sauce, best when cooked over real charcoal</li>
                    <li><strong>Hainanese chicken rice</strong> — Deceptively simple, impossibly delicious</li>

                <p>I used to think I knew tacos.

            <div>
                <p>The differences from what I knew were immediate:<br />Corn tortillas made hours ago, not days.<br />Meat carved directly from the spit, glistening with pineapple juice.<br />Salsas ground fresh that morning in a molcajete.</p>

                <h2>The Recipe That Changed Everything</h2>
            </section>

            <div>
                <p>After that Bangkok pad thai experience, I became obsessed with recreating it. The vendor—her name was <strong>Khun Lek</strong>—eventually showed me her technique. The secret wasn't a secret ingredient; it was <em>heat management</em> and the correct <code>sauce ratio</code>.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <pre data-language="python"><code># Khun Lek's Pad Thai Sauce Ratio
# The balance is everything

def make_sauce(servings):
    """The holy trinity: sweet, sour, salty, umami."""
    return {
        'tamarind_paste': 2 * servings,    # tbsp - the sour
        'fish_sauce': 1.5 * servings,       # tbsp - the salt + umami
        'palm_sugar': 1.5 * servings,       # tbsp - the sweet
        'water': 1 * servings               # tbsp - to bring it together
    }

# Never use ketchup. Never.</code></pre>
            </div>

                        <p>The wok must be screaming hot—hotter than any home stove can typically achieve. This is why restaurant pad thai never quite matches the street version. Khun Lek's wok runs at temperatures that would terrify a home cook.</p>

            <div>
                <p><em>Wok hei</em>—the "breath of the wok"—is that elusive smoky, slightly charred flavor that distinguishes great stir-fries. You can only achieve it with extreme heat and fast movement. Home cooks can approximate it by cooking in very small batches. Serious street vendors in Asia use carbon steel woks that have been seasoned over years of daily use—the patina is irreplaceable.</p>

            </section>

            <div>
                <p>Why does street food cost so little? The economics are fascinating. No rent for dining rooms. No wait staff. Minimal overhead. The vendor's only costs are ingredients, equipment, and their own labor—and when you've been making the same dish for thirty years, your efficiency is <strong>extraordinary</strong>.</p>
