                <h2>Why Street Food Matters</h2>
            </section>

            <div>
                <p>It was 2 AM in Bangkok when I had the best meal of my life. Standing in a narrow alley lit by a single fluorescent bulb, I watched a woman who must have been seventy years old flip pad thai in a wok that looked older than me. The noodles hit the plate with a sizzle, and within seconds I was eating something that put every restaurant version I'd ever tried to shame.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>That's the magic of street food. It's not about fancy plating or Michelin stars. It's about generations of technique, passed from grandmother to mother to daughter, refined by repetition until the movements become muscle memory. It's food made with soul.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Walk through any city's oldest neighborhoods, and you'll find street vendors who've been working the same corner for decades. These aren't people chasing trends—they're culinary historians, keeping recipes alive that might otherwise disappear into the homogenized blur of global food chains.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pad Thai — The iconic stir-fried noodles, best from vendors using tamarind paste</li>
                    <li>Bánh mì — Vietnam's perfect fusion of French baguette and local fillings</li>
                    <li>Tacos al pastor — Meat carved directly from the spit, glistening with pineapple juice</li>
                    <li>Satay — Grilled skewers with peanut sauce, cooked over real charcoal</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>The best meals I've ever eaten weren't in restaurants. They were on plastic stools, at folding tables, in places I found by accident. That's the promise of street food: honest cooking, made by people who've spent their lives perfecting a craft.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Southeast Asia: Where Street Food Reigns</h2>
            </section>

            <div>
                <p>Nowhere on earth takes street food more seriously than Southeast Asia. In Thailand, Singapore, and Vietnam, eating out often means eating on the street—even for the wealthy. The hawker stall isn't a budget compromise; it's where you go for the best food.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>The region's tropical climate shaped these traditions. With heat and humidity making home cooking uncomfortable, outdoor food stalls became the default kitchen for entire neighborhoods.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pad Thai</strong> — Stir-fried rice noodles with tamarind, fish sauce, and palm sugar</li>
                    <li><strong>Bánh mì</strong> — Crispy baguettes stuffed with pâté, pickled vegetables, and herbs</li>
                    <li><strong>Satay</strong> — Grilled skewers with rich peanut sauce</li>
                    <li><strong>Hainanese chicken rice</strong> — Poached chicken over fragrant rice</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>The key to finding the best vendors is simple: follow the locals. If a stall has a line of office workers at lunch, that's your target.</p>

                        <p>In Bangkok, follow the smoke. The best grilled meats come from vendors who've been tending their charcoal for hours—look for the gentle glow of well-established coals, not aggressive flames.</p>

                <h2>Mexico: The Art of the Taco</h2>
            </section>

            <div>
                <p>I used to think I knew tacos. Then I went to Mexico City at midnight and stood in line with cab drivers, nurses getting off shift, and club kids in sequins—all waiting for the same tacos al pastor from a vendor whose trompo had been spinning since afternoon.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>The differences from what I knew were immediate. Corn tortillas made hours ago, not days. Meat carved directly from the spit, glistening with pineapple juice. Salsas ground fresh that morning in a molcajete.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Mexican street food operates on a different philosophy than restaurants. Here, specialization is everything. A taquero might spend thirty years perfecting a single preparation.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Never eat a taco with a fork—it's considered an insult to the craft</li>
                    <li>Double tortilla is standard, not excessive</li>
                    <li>Lime first, then salsa—trust the traditional order</li>
                    <li>Standing up is traditional; embrace the experience</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>The taco stands of Mexico City represent something increasingly rare: food made by masters who've dedicated their lives to a single dish.</p>

                <p>In the narrow alleys of Marrakech's medina, the air hangs thick with cumin and woodsmoke. An elderly man tends a clay pot of tangia—lamb shoulder slow-cooked overnight in the embers of a hammam furnace. When he lifts the lid, the meat falls apart at the mere suggestion of a fork.</p>
