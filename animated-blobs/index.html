                    <p>Engineers and scientists use advanced technology to grow plants in controlled environments, even in space. The data they gather helps improve indoor farming on Earth. Indoor farming can solve problems like the need for <strong>sustainable</strong> food in cities. This is an example of how smart solutions can tackle big challenges, like the issues of urban sprawl, and make cities better.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Start by clearly defining the problem. For example, urban sprawl leads to environmental and social issues.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Divide the problem into key areas, such as transportation, housing, and green spaces. Focus on each area for specific issues.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    <h2>Manage Urban Sprawl Impacts</h2>
                    <p>Urban sprawl can lead to problems that often harm humans, the environment, and other living organisms. To keep our cities healthy, it is important to create solutions that reduce these impacts. By managing how cities grow, we can protect nature while allowing for development.</p>

                    <p>Here's a simple guide on how to create these solutions. We start by investigating the problem, then we create solutions and integrate them into an effective plan.</p>

                    <h2>Create</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Create solutions that directly address the challenges in transportation, housing, and green spaces. Focus on solving the specific problems in each area.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Growing cities mean that more single-family homes are built in suburban areas. This spreads cities farther and uses more land and resources. Often, this leads to the loss of farmland and natural habitats, which harms local ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>These maps model the changes in the landscape in Philadelphia from 1900 to 2010. They also project the landscape in the year 2100, where low-density and high-density urban areas dominate.</p>

                    <h2>Integrate</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Combine all the solutions into one plan. Ensure they work together to make cities more sustainable and livable. Building more roads and highways also breaks up natural habitats. This isolates animal populations and reduces biodiversity.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Transportation Solutions</h2>

                    <p>Investing in public transportation, like buses, trains, and bike lanes, can make city travel easier and cleaner. These options reduce the need for cars, and this lowers pollution and improves air quality. Focusing on public transit can create a more efficient and eco-friendly way to get around.</p>

                    <p>The image shows that public transportation produces much lower greenhouse gas emissions, with rail at 2%. This proves that it is a better option than private vehicles, like light-duty cars, which contribute a much higher 57% of emissions.</p>

                    <p>These developments also create more impervious surfaces, like driveways and roads. This increases runoff and the risk of flooding.</p>

                    <p data-nodeid="78">Concrete pavers, as seen in this diagram, are great for permeable pavements because they're strong and durable. They have gaps that let water soak through, reducing runoff and preventing floods.</p>
                    <p data-nodeid="79">A permeable pavement can be made of stone pavers with a concrete border. It can be combined with gravel and grass. These materials work together to create a useful and attractive landscape.</p>
