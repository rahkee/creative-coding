                        <p>Urban sprawl can lead to problems that often harm humans, the environment, and other living organisms. To keep our cities healthy, it is important to create solutions that reduce these impacts. By managing how cities grow, we can protect nature while allowing for development.</p>

                        <p>Here's a simple guide on how to create these solutions. We start by investigating the problem, then we create solutions and integrate them into an effective plan.</p>

                        <p>As cities grow, distances between homes, work, and shopping areas increase. This leads to greater reliance on cars.

                        <p>Transportation in urban sprawl heavily relies on petroleum, as shown in the graph. This leads to increased emissions and pollution.</p>

                        <h2>Transportation Solutions</h2>

                        <p>Investing in public transportation, like buses, trains, and bike lanes, can make city travel easier and cleaner. These options reduce the need for cars, and this lowers pollution and improves air quality. Focusing on public transit can create a more efficient and eco-friendly way to get around.</p>

                        <p>The image shows that public transportation produces much lower greenhouse gas emissions, with rail at 2%. This proves that it is a better option than private vehicles, like light-duty cars, which contribute a much higher 57% of emissions.</p>

                        <p>These developments also create more impervious surfaces, like driveways and roads. This increases runoff and the risk of flooding.</p>

                        <p data-nodeid="78">Concrete pavers, as seen in this diagram, are great for permeable pavements because they're strong and durable. They have gaps that let water soak through, reducing runoff and preventing floods.</p>
                        <p data-nodeid="79">A permeable pavement can be made of stone pavers with a concrete border. It can be combined with gravel and grass. These materials work together to create a useful and attractive landscape.</p>
